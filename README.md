# spring-aop

Spring AOP is powerful feature for Aspect Oriented Programming which provides the modularity by cross cutting consern. 
A cross-cutting concern is a concern that can affect the whole application and should be centralized in one location in code as possible,
such as transaction management, authentication, logging, security etc.
